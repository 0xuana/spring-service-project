# Part 3: Comprehensive Testing Strategy (No Database Required)

This document outlines the comprehensive testing implementation for both Employee and Department services, following Part 3 requirements.

## Coverage Target

**Target: 80% line coverage, 75% branch coverage**

## Test Types Implemented

### 1. Unit Tests (Jupiter + Mocking)
Location: `**/service/*Test.java`

**Employee Service Tests:**
- `EmployeeServiceTest.java`: Comprehensive testing of all service methods
  - ✅ `getAll()` - empty list, with enrichment, client failures
  - ✅ `getById()` - found, not found, with/without department
  - ✅ `create()` - duplicate validation, field mapping, null department

**Department Service Tests:**
- `DepartmentServiceTest.java`: Complete business rule testing
  - ✅ `getAll()` - empty list, multiple departments
  - ✅ `getById()` - found, not found scenarios
  - ✅ `create()` - duplicate validation (case-insensitive), field mapping

**Features:**
- Parameterized tests for multiple input scenarios
- Nested test classes for logical grouping
- Mock verification for proper service behavior
- Edge case testing (null values, exceptions)

### 2. Web Slice Tests (@WebMvcTest)
Location: `**/web/*ControllerTest.java`

**Employee Controller Tests:**
- ✅ GET `/api/v1/employees` - empty list, populated list
- ✅ GET `/api/v1/employees/{id}` - success, 404 not found
- ✅ POST `/api/v1/employees` - validation errors (400), success (201), duplicate (409)
- ✅ Validation: missing fields, invalid email, malformed JSON

**Department Controller Tests:**
- ✅ GET `/api/v1/departments` - empty list, populated list
- ✅ GET `/api/v1/departments/{id}` - success, 404 not found
- ✅ POST `/api/v1/departments` - validation errors (400), success (201), duplicate (409)
- ✅ Validation: missing name, field length limits, content type handling

**Features:**
- ProblemDetail assertion for error responses
- JSON path validation for response structure
- HTTP status code verification
- Content type validation

### 3. SpringBootTest (No Database)
Location: `**/*ApplicationTest.java`

**Full Context Tests:**
- ✅ Real Spring context loading (excluding DataSource/JPA/Flyway)
- ✅ Mocked repositories and external clients
- ✅ End-to-end request/response testing via MockMvc
- ✅ Integration testing of all layers (Controller → Service → Repository)

**Employee Service Application Tests:**
- Complete CRUD workflow testing
- Department client failure handling
- Transaction boundary verification
- ProblemDetail error response validation

**Department Service Application Tests:**
- Full department lifecycle testing
- Case-insensitive duplicate validation
- Service layer integration testing
- Exception propagation verification

### 4. Exception Handling Tests
Location: `**/web/*ExceptionTest.java` (from Part 1)

- ✅ ProblemDetail format validation
- ✅ HTTP status code mapping (400, 404, 409, 500)
- ✅ Error response structure verification
- ✅ Controller short-circuit behavior testing

## CRUD Coverage Matrix

| Operation | Employee Service | Department Service |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| **CREATE** | ✅ Unit, Web, Integration | ✅ Unit, Web, Integration |
| **READ (All)** | ✅ Unit, Web, Integration | ✅ Unit, Web, Integration |
| **READ (By ID)** | ✅ Unit, Web, Integration | ✅ Unit, Web, Integration |
| **UPDATE** | ⚠️ Not implemented yet | ⚠️ Not implemented yet |
| **DELETE** | ⚠️ Not implemented yet | ⚠️ Not implemented yet |

*Note: UPDATE and DELETE operations will be implemented in Part 4*

## Positive/Negative Test Cases

### Employee Service
**Positive Cases:**
- ✅ Create employee with valid data
- ✅ Get employee by existing ID
- ✅ Get all employees (empty and populated)
- ✅ Department enrichment success
- ✅ Employee without department

**Negative Cases:**
- ✅ Create with duplicate email (409)
- ✅ Get employee by non-existent ID (404)
- ✅ Validation failures (400)
- ✅ Department client failures (graceful handling)
- ✅ Malformed JSON requests (400)

### Department Service
**Positive Cases:**
- ✅ Create department with valid name
- ✅ Create department without description
- ✅ Get department by existing ID
- ✅ Get all departments (empty and populated)

**Negative Cases:**
- ✅ Create with duplicate name - case insensitive (409)
- ✅ Get department by non-existent ID (404)
- ✅ Validation failures - missing/empty name (400)
- ✅ Field length violations (400)
- ✅ Malformed JSON requests (400)

## Running Tests

### Single Command for All Tests

```bash
# Option 1: Using test script
./run-all-tests.sh

# Option 2: Using Maven directly
mvn clean test

# Option 3: Using Maven profile
mvn clean test -Ptest-all
```

### Individual Service Tests

```bash
# Employee service only
mvn -pl employee-service test

# Department service only
mvn -pl department-service test
```

### Coverage Reports

```bash
# Generate coverage reports
mvn -pl employee-service jacoco:report
mvn -pl department-service jacoco:report

# Check coverage thresholds
mvn -pl employee-service jacoco:check
mvn -pl department-service jacoco:check
```

**Coverage Report Locations:**
- Employee Service: `employee-service/target/site/jacoco/index.html`
- Department Service: `department-service/target/site/jacoco/index.html`

## Test Configuration

### Profiles Used
- `@ActiveProfiles("test")` - Excludes database configuration
- Test-specific application.yml configurations disable:
  - DataSource and JPA
  - Flyway migrations
  - Eureka client registration

### Mock Strategy
- **Repositories**: `@MockBean` for database abstraction
- **External Clients**: `@MockBean` for service-to-service calls
- **Full Context**: SpringBootTest with mocked infrastructure

### Coverage Configuration
- **JaCoCo Plugin**: Configured in both service POMs
- **Minimum Thresholds**:
  - Line Coverage: 80%
  - Branch Coverage: 75%
- **Reports**: HTML format in `target/site/jacoco/`

## Test Execution Results

When you run `./run-all-tests.sh`, you'll see:

✅ **Unit Tests**: Service layer business rules and edge cases
✅ **Web Slice Tests**: Controller validation and response handling
✅ **SpringBootTest**: Full context integration without database
✅ **Coverage Check**: Automated verification of coverage thresholds
✅ **Exception Handling**: ProblemDetail format compliance

## Benefits of This Testing Strategy

1. **Fast Execution**: No database dependency means quick test cycles
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All layers tested (Controller → Service → Repository)
3. **Realistic Testing**: SpringBootTest provides near-production behavior
4. **Maintainable**: Clear separation of test types and responsibilities
5. **CI/CD Ready**: Single command execution with coverage enforcement
6. **Developer Friendly**: Detailed test names and nested organization

## Next Steps

Part 4 will add UPDATE and DELETE operations, which will require:
- Additional controller endpoints
- Enhanced service methods
- Extended test coverage for complete CRUD operations
- Business rule validation for DELETE operations
